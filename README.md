I'm a little tired today. The agency in the UK has come to the news. There are a lot of materials to fill in and letters of recommendation. I don't know those professors. How can I ask others to write letters of recommendation for me? There's a 7-hour time difference in the agency, and the reply is very slow. I'm very tired
